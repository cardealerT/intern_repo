<h1>BioNix Intern Repository</h1>
Initially made for Intake 12 Sem1 2025 BioNix Team.

Allowed us to centralise all our code in one place, and gain insight into our teammate's progress.

Should you wish to use this repo for your intake, fork the repository or contact me @ the email below so I can transfer ownership.

Assuming the wiki they provide you with is the same as ours, you may notice it is a bit lacking on up-to-date info. Hence, please feel free to ask me any questions about the BioNix project. Being able to ask previous interns questions is something we sorely wished we had. Also just having their code to begin with would've been nice.

As of writing this (May 12 2025) your next steps should be (a) getting VIRUSBreakend to work (b) pushing towards BioNix. Once Shizhe has RepeatMasker in nixpkgs and I clean up Kraken2, all your dependencies will be available to use, so this shouldn't be too difficult. 

I have provided you with a very basic template derivation and flake for what I think your VIRUSBreakend will end up becoming, though **do not** base your work on this script. It's a starting point and is probably littered with errors. 
Unless all our stuff has been successfully merged into nixpkgs, I also wouldn't really take our work as gospel for what you aspire to write. We are interns, which means our code is inherently sloppy. 
What we have here, aside from being what we completed over our Internship, is more like a general guide for how a new Nix user should write derivations. 

Please, please, please refer to the official nixpkgs and BioNix scripts as full proof examples for how your code should look - BioNix particularly for VIRUSBreakend. Those scripts have undergone heavy public scrutiny before they were merged into their respective codebases.

I will try to keep my code up to date should I make any changes to kraken2 in nixpkgs, although I presume this very well could be an excellent beginning exercise to get familiar with nix, derivations and the like. 

P.S. Momentum is key, but uni assignments, midterms, and pull requests really kill it. Get as much help as you can from Justin and Rowland early on and fall on them for anything. Justin is really great for the technical stuff, and Rowland is really great for the high-level and organisational stuff.

Have fun!
